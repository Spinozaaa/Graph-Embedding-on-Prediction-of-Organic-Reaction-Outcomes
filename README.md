## Graph Embedding on Prediction of Organic Reaction Outcomes
Chemical reaction prediction is an important branch in the field of computational
chemistry and is computationally intractable. It includes continuous embedding and generation of molecular graphs, and the former one 
is previously approached by some traditional graph embedding algorithms or message passing neural network, a classical graph neural network(GNN). 
However, this part plays an important role on the performance of the model and it can be improved. 
So far many excellent GNN have emerged. 
And our primary contribution is to implement the embedding part of molecular graphs with some of these. 
We use three types of GNN and compare their effects on two datasets. And we demonstrate that all of them
outperform the message passing neural network.
